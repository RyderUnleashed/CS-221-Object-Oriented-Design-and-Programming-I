# CS-221-Object-Oriented-Design-and-Programming-I

These are rudimentary projects that I coded and submitted in my CS-221 class.

To prevent anyone, and myself for that matter, from violating University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh's Academic Honesty Policy,
these projects are my own intellectual property and are to not be reused and resubmitted under someone else's name.
These projects will remain UNLICENSED. Follow github's licensing policy and copyright laws.

That being said, feel free to download and test my submitted code. These were coded in Java using BlueJ.
